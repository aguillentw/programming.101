# Goal
This is the repository of exercises to accelerate the onboarding of _career changers_ our projects.

The idea is to create a set of exercises on different programming topics increasing the exposure 
of the developer to such topics.

# Content
Although the original content of the program is designed for a specific individual based on
the tech stack currently in use, the technology choices are wide spread among the community
and can be easily adopted by other developers.

  1. [Data types, variables](doc/java/10_data_types)
  2. [Conditionals](doc/java/20_conditionals)
  3. [Functions](doc/java/30_fuctions)
